Combine your images into a multi page pdf

I gave up on finding a online tool that let me create PDFs with hundreds of pages from my images, so I wrote one myself. Feel free to use for all your converting needs.

-HOW TO USE-
Start the application and select the folder with your images. This will create a PDF in that folder containing all compatible images in alphabetical order.
